            <h4>A Story about the Wisdom of Nature</h4><br>
            <p>In a small village surrounded by green hills and flowing rivers, stood an ancient banyan tree. It was the
                oldest living being in the village—strong, tall, and peaceful. People called it “The Whispering Tree”
                because they believed it could talk to those who listened closely.

                Children played in its shade, the elders rested under its branches, and travelers stopped to find
                shelter beneath it. The tree had seen generations grow and pass, but it remained rooted, quietly
                observing life.

                One summer, a young boy named Arjun came to the tree, upset and angry. His crops had failed due to lack
                of rain, and he felt nature had betrayed him.

                He shouted, “You call yourself great, Nature? You give us floods, droughts, storms—how are you our
                friend?”

                Suddenly, the wind blew gently through the banyan’s leaves, making a rustling sound. Arjun sat down,
                exhausted, and slowly began to listen. The leaves seemed to whisper:

                “I have stood here for over 300 years. I have seen storms and sunshine, war and peace. Nature does not
                harm; it only teaches.
                When there is a flood, I grow stronger roots.
                When there is drought, I store water deep inside.
                Life will not always be fair, but those who adapt and stay rooted will survive and grow.”
                Arjun sat silently, the anger in his heart slowly fading. He realized that instead of blaming nature, he
                needed to learn from it. He began studying farming techniques, learning how to conserve water, use
                organic methods, and respect the soil.

                Over the years, his land flourished. People from nearby villages came to learn from him. And every time
                he passed the banyan tree, he bowed respectfully — for it had not only given him shade but also wisdom.

            <h4>🍃 Moral of the Story:</h4><br>
            <p>Nature is not against us. It is our greatest teacher — silent, strong, and full of wisdom. We just have to slow down and listen.</p><br><br>

            <h4>– The Journey of Dr. A.P.J. Abdul Kalam</h4><br>
            <p>Once in a small town called Rameswaram, lived a humble boy named Avul Pakir Jainulabdeen Abdul Kalam.
                Born in a poor family, he helped his father in his early years by distributing newspapers to support his
                education. But young Kalam had a fire in his heart — he dreamed of flying high in the sky. His greatest
                desire was to become a fighter pilot in the Indian Air Force.

                Years of hard work and dedication led him to the final round of the IAF pilot selection. There were only
                8 seats, and Kalam secured the 9th position. He was rejected.
                The dream he had nurtured for so long was suddenly out of reach.

                For many, such rejection would have meant defeat. But not for Kalam. Though heartbroken, he didn't give
                up. Instead of mourning his failure, he took it as a lesson, a redirection of fate. He once said:

                “Sometimes, failure is more beneficial than success. It teaches you what success cannot.”
                He joined the Defense Research and Development Organisation (DRDO) and later the Indian Space Research
                Organisation (ISRO). There, he led the development of India’s satellite launch vehicle and played a key
                role in the Pokhran-II nuclear tests.

                Years later, the boy who once failed to become a pilot became known as “The Missile Man of India.” He
                was honored with India’s highest civilian award, the Bharat Ratna, and ultimately rose to become the
                11th President of India, earning love and respect from millions.

                His journey from rejection to reverence continues to inspire millions across the globe. He proved that
                failure is not the end, but a beginning.

            <h4>🕊️ Final Words:</h4><br>
            <p>"Don’t read success stories, you will only get a message.
                Read failure stories, you will get some ideas to succeed."<b> – Dr. A.P.J. Abdul Kalam</b></p><br><br>
